# Coursera: IBM Data Science Professional Certificate
## Course 9: Machine Learning with Python

### Purpose:

- The final project for the Machine Learning segment of IBM's Data Science certificate is optinal and labeled as Honors. In the project, a rainfall dataset from the Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology will be used. The dataset will be cleaned and different classification algorithms will be applied to the data.

## **Below is from the assignment itself**
___

### You are expected to use the following algorithms to build your models:

1.  Linear Regression
2.  KNN
3.  Decision Trees
4.  Logistic Regression
5.  SVM

### The results are reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:

1. Accuracy Score
2. Jaccard Index
3. F1-Score
4. LogLoss
5. Mean Absolute Error
6. Mean Squared Error
7. R2-Score
